# **Constructing a Cloud Infrastructure Using AWS**  

## **Introduction**  
This project focuses on setting up a secure, scalable, and efficient cloud-based infrastructure using AWS. It includes key AWS services like **VPC, EC2, S3, RDS, EFS, Auto Scaling, Load Balancer, CloudWatch, CloudTrail**, and more to create a fully functional cloud environment.

## **Project Overview**  
The cloud setup includes:  
üîπ **Networking & Security**  
- Virtual Private Cloud (**VPC**) with **Public & Private Subnets**  
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)** for public access  
- **NAT Gateway** for private subnet internet access  
- **Route Tables & NACLs** for traffic control  
- **Security Groups & IAM** for access management  

üîπ **Compute & Storage**  
- **EC2 Instances** for scalable computing  
- **Load Balancer (ELB)** for traffic distribution  
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** for fault tolerance  
- **Amazon S3** for object storage  
- **Amazon EFS** for shared file storage  

üîπ **Monitoring & Logging**  
- **Amazon CloudWatch** for real-time monitoring  
- **AWS CloudTrail** for tracking API activity  
- **VPC Flow Logs** for analyzing network traffic  

üîπ **Event-Driven & Messaging Services**  
- **Amazon SNS** for event-driven notifications

## **Setup Steps**  
### **1. Creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**  
- Created **MyVpc** with **CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16** in AWS.  
- Added **public and private subnets** for proper segmentation.  

### **2. Setting Up Networking Components**  
- **Public & Private Subnets**  
- **Internet Gateway (IGW) for external access**  
- **NAT Gateway for private subnets**  
- **Route Tables & NACLs** to manage network traffic  

### **3. Configuring EC2 Instances & Load Balancer**  
- Launched EC2 instances in PublicSubnet-A & PublicSubnet-B  
- Configured **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** for high availability  
- Set up an **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**  

### **4. Implementing AWS Storage Solutions**  
- Configured **Amazon S3 Buckets**  
- Set up **Amazon EFS** for scalable storage  

### **5. Security & Access Management**  
- Created **IAM Roles & Security Groups**  
- Implemented **AWS CloudTrail & VPC Flow Logs** for auditing  

### **6. Monitoring & Notifications**  
- Configured **CloudWatch Dashboards** to monitor EC2 performance  
- Set up **SNS** for system alerts
